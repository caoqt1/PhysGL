# PhysGL
An archived version of Paril's Quake II mod.

I have had success compiling it with Visual Studio 2010. You'll need to build the binaries for bullet for the physics.
You can find the version used with the mod over on the google code archive: https://code.google.com/archive/p/bullet/downloads
Specifically, it is 'bullet-trunk-svn-rev2338'

You will also need to fetch the .lib file for openal32.

Once you have all that, you should be able to compile the mod without issue. **HOWEVER**, the mod is nowhere near usable, since it lacks the assets, you can get some assets (such as the fonts) over at Paril's EGL backup (https://github.com/Paril/egl)
