# PhysGL
A backup of Paril's Quake II mod.

I have had success compiling it with Visual Studio 2010. You'll need to build the binaries for bullet for the physics.
You can find the version used with the mod over on the google code archive: https://code.google.com/archive/p/bullet/downloads
Specifically, it is 'bullet-trunk-svn-rev2338'

Once you have all that, you should be able to compile the mod without issue. **HOWEVER**, the mod is nowhere near usable. I've been able to find replacement fonts that work.

The current assets are located in the baseq2 folder.
## PULL REQUESTS RELATED TO RESTORING THE ASSETS WILL BE ACCEPTED!
